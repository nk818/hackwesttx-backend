# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## Current Issues Identified

1. ✅ **Railway Configuration**: Your `railway.json` and `Procfile` are correct
2. ✅ **Django Settings**: Properly configured for Railway deployment
3. ✅ **MongoDB Integration**: Added MongoDB support to Django
4. ❌ **URL Accessibility**: Need to verify Railway deployment

## Steps to Fix Railway Deployment

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Railway

Run these commands in your Railway project:

```bash
# Set MongoDB connection
railway variables set MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://noahkueng1_db_user:tc2FviW6Wa5kxjEO@cluster0.bn7mgbx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

# Set Django settings
railway variables set DEBUG=False
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Set CORS settings for your frontend
railway variables set CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com,http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Connect to Railway (if not already connected)
railway login
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 3. Test Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

- **Health Check**: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/health/`
- **API Root**: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/`
- **Debug Info**: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/debug/`

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: URLs not accessible
**Solution**: Check Railway logs for errors:
```bash
railway logs
```

#### Issue: MongoDB connection fails
**Solution**: The SSL issue is common. The app will work with SQLite as primary database and MongoDB as secondary.

#### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in Railway variables.

### 5. Verify Deployment

1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. Test health endpoint: `curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health/`
3. Check logs for any errors: `railway logs`

## Current Configuration Summary

✅ **Django Settings**: Configured for Railway
✅ **URL Routing**: All endpoints properly configured
✅ **MongoDB Integration**: Added with fallback to SQLite
✅ **Health Check**: Enhanced with MongoDB status
✅ **CORS**: Configured for all origins

## Next Steps

1. Set the environment variables in Railway
2. Redeploy your application
3. Test the health endpoint
4. Check Railway logs for any issues

Your Django application is properly configured for Railway deployment.
