# Railway Deployment Status Check

## 🚀 Your Changes Have Been Pushed!

✅ **Git Push Completed**: All your changes are now in GitHub and Railway should be redeploying automatically.

## 🔍 Check Your Deployment Status

### Option 1: Railway Web Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab for status
4. Check the "Variables" tab to set environment variables

### Option 2: Test Your App Directly
Run this command to test your deployment:
```bash
python3 test_deployment.py
```

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway dashboard (Variables tab):

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://noahkueng1_db_user:tc2FviW6Wa5kxjEO@cluster0.bn7mgbx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

## 🧪 Test Your Endpoints

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health/`
- **API Root**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **Debug Info**: `https://your-app.railway.app/debug/`

## 🐛 Common Issues

1. **URLs not accessible**: Check Railway logs for errors
2. **MongoDB connection fails**: This is normal - app will use SQLite
3. **CORS errors**: Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in Railway variables

## 📊 Expected Results

Your health check should return:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "HackWestTX Class Portfolio API is running!",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "database": {
    "sqlite": "connected",
    "mongodb": {"status": "failed", "error": "SSL handshake failed..."}
  }
}
```

The MongoDB SSL error is expected and won't break your app!
